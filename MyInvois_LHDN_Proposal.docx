Executive Summary

Overview

The document is to propose [Client Company Name] (hereafter refer as "CLIENT") to engage [Your Company Name] (hereafter refer as "VENDOR") to develop and implement a comprehensive MyInvois LHDN e-Invoice system for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. The solution will enable CLIENT to comply with Malaysian LHDN (Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri) e-Invoice requirements and streamline their invoicing processes through digital transformation.

Current Environment

CLIENT currently manages their invoicing processes manually or through traditional systems, which leads to several operational inefficiencies:

Manual Invoice Processing – Invoices are created and managed manually, leading to delays, errors, and increased administrative overhead.

Lack of Digital Compliance – Current processes may not fully comply with LHDN MyInvois e-Invoice requirements, risking non-compliance penalties.

Limited Integration – Invoice data may not be properly integrated with financial systems, leading to data silos and reconciliation challenges.

No Real-time Tracking – Lack of visibility into invoice status, submission results, and compliance metrics.

To overcome these issues, CLIENT seeks to implement a comprehensive e-Invoice solution that integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, ensures full LHDN compliance, and provides real-time visibility into the entire invoicing lifecycle.

Objective

To develop and deliver the MyInvois LHDN e-Invoice System for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, enabling CLIENT to:

Achieve full compliance with LHDN MyInvois e-Invoice requirements for digital invoicing in Malaysia.

Streamline invoice processing from creation to LHDN submission through automated workflows.

Enable real-time tracking and monitoring of invoice status, validation results, and compliance metrics.

Integrate seamlessly with existing Business Central processes and data structures.

Provide comprehensive audit trails and reporting capabilities for regulatory compliance.

Support both B2B and B2G transactions with appropriate document types and validation rules.

Ensure secure digital signing and submission of invoices to LHDN API endpoints.

Empower users with intuitive interfaces for invoice management and status monitoring.

Requirements

As VENDOR understanding, CLIENT is looking for solutions which could address:

Full UBL 2.1 compliance for generating structured JSON invoices as required by LHDN.

Digital signing integration using JOTEX P12 certificates through Azure Functions.

Direct API integration with LHDN MyInvois for invoice submission and status tracking.

Seamless integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central sales processes.

Real-time TIN validation for customers to ensure data accuracy.

Support for all LHDN document types (01-Invoice, 02-Credit Note, 03-Debit Note, 04-Refund Note, 11-14 Self-billed variants).

Automated field population and validation based on Business Central data.

Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms for failed submissions.

Complete audit logging and compliance reporting capabilities.

Role-based access control ensuring appropriate security and data visibility.

Real-time dashboards and notifications for invoice status monitoring.

Bulk processing capabilities for high-volume invoice scenarios.

Mobile-responsive user interfaces for cross-device accessibility.

Multi-language support (English/Malay) for diverse user groups.
